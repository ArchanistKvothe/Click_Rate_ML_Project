# Click_Rate_ML_Project
In this project, I walk through the steps involved in creating a Machine learning model that predicts click through rate. 
I go over the loading procedure I followed through SQL Alchemy, then I go over the steps taken to visualize and understand the data I have. 
I show my cleaning steps datatype conversions taken to ensure that necesary calculations can be made.
I go over my feature engineered columns and the reasoning behind each one. 
Following the previous steps, I then create my first model. 
It is a basic model with minimal steps to see how my it performs without any serious hyperparamter tuning or specific encoding.
The using lime I see what features work and which ones do not. 
Then comes the advanced models where I'm target encoding specific columns, one-hot-encoding some and ordinal encoding the the rest.
After a few models with tweaked hyperparamters comes the final model.
Then comes my final thoughts and conlusion on the results of my work.
